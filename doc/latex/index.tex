This is the documentation of the Incremental\+FE library. The main purpose of the library is to help with the solution of problems formulated in terms of incremental variational principles. The library is essentially a wrapper around the functionalities provided by the Galerkin\+Tools library, which adds solution algorithms for non-\/linear, time-\/dependent problems.

As there is presently no version available which works in parallel on distributed memory, the library can only be used for small to medium sized problems, which can be solved on a single machine. Still, the library can be useful in the context of large problems by helping in comparing different finite element formulations based on smaller test problems as well as by providing a reference implementation.

Before you start, it is recommended to first get an understanding of the Galerkin\+Tools library. Also, a good knowledge of the open source finite element library \href{http://www.dealii.org}{\tt deal.\+II} will be beneficial because the Galerkin\+Tools library builds mainly on that libary.
