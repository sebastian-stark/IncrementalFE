/*! \mainpage IncrementalFE library
 *
 * This is the documentation of the IncrementalFE library. The library builds on the GalerkinTools library and adds some
 * functionality related to the solution of transient problems by one step time integration algorithms. 
 * In particular, it includes a Newton-Raphson based solver for the non-linear problems arising in each time step.
 * 
 * Currently, restriction is made to problems, which involve only first order time derivatives.
